### 1. Introduction

#### What is Expense Pro?

Expense Pro is a modern application designed to give you clarity and control over your financial life. Our goal is to make tracking expenses, creating budgets, and achieving financial goals an intuitive and empowering experience, not a chore. We use AI to simplify complex tasks and provide you with actionable insights.

#### Who is it for?

- Individuals who want to understand their spending habits.
- Couples and families managing shared household finances.
- Freelancers and small business owners needing simple expense tracking.
- Investors who want a consolidated view of their portfolio.
- Anyone looking for a powerful, privacy-focused alternative to subscription-based finance apps.

### 2. üöÄ Getting Started

#### Signing Up

1.  Navigate to the signup page.
2.  Enter your full name, email address, and a secure password (at least 8 characters).
3.  Optionally, you can upload a profile picture.
4.  Click "Create Account".
5.  You will receive a verification email. Follow the instructions to verify your account and log in.

#### Creating Your First Account

An "Account" in Expense Pro represents a real-world place where you hold money, like a bank account, credit card, or digital wallet.

1.  After logging in, you'll be on the **Accounts** page.
2.  Click the **"Create Account"** button.
3.  Give your account a name (e.g., "Main Bank Account").
4.  Enter the current balance of that account. This is your starting point.
5.  Select the correct currency.
6.  Click "Create". That's it! You're ready to start adding transactions.

#### Understanding the Layout

The main interface is divided into two parts:

- **Sidebar (Left):** This is your main navigation. It gives you access to all the major sections of the app like Dashboard, Transactions, Accounts, and all the Planning tools.
- **Main Content Area (Right):** This is where the content for the selected section is displayed.

### 3. üìä The Dashboard: Your Financial Command Center

The Dashboard (`/dashboard`) is your high-level overview. It provides a real-time snapshot of your financial health.

- **Financial Snapshot & Quick Stats:** See your overall net balance, total income vs. expense, and key figures like your highest and lowest transactions for the selected period.
- **Financial Trends:** A chart that visualizes your income, expenses, and balance over time. You can switch between Line, Bar, and Area chart views.
- **Spending Breakdown:** A pie or column chart showing which categories you're spending the most money on.
- **Financial Health Score:** An intelligent score that assesses your financial wellness and provides simple, actionable feedback.

### 4. üí∏ Managing Transactions

This section (`/transactions`) is a detailed list of all your financial activities.

#### Adding an Expense or Income

1.  Click the **"Add Transaction"** button.
2.  First, select whether it's an **Expense** or **Income**.
3.  Fill in the details:
    - **Description:** What the transaction was for (e.g., "Weekly Groceries").
    - **Amount:** The monetary value.
    - **Account:** Which account the money came from or went into.
    - **Category:** The spending category (e.g., "Food", "Transport"). You can create new categories on the fly!
    - **Date and Time:** When the transaction occurred.
4.  Click "Add" to save it.

#### Editing and Deleting Transactions

In the transactions list, you can click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) to edit any detail or the trash can icon (üóëÔ∏è) to delete a transaction.

#### Searching and Filtering

Use the search bar and the **Filters** button to find specific transactions. You can filter by date range, account, category, amount, and more.

### 5. üè¶ Managing Accounts

#### Creating and Managing Multiple Accounts

On the **Accounts** page (`/accounts`), you can add as many accounts as you need (e.g., Savings Account, Credit Card, PayPal, Cash Wallet). This helps you get a complete picture of your finances.

#### Sharing Accounts with Others

This is perfect for managing a household budget with a partner.

1.  From the **Account Details** page, click the **"Share"** button.
2.  Enter the email address of the Expense Pro user you want to share with. You can also invite a new user by typing their full email.
3.  The user will get an invitation. Once they accept, the shared account will appear in their dashboard, distinctly separate from their own private accounts.
4.  **Privacy Note:** They will _only_ see the account you shared, not your other personal accounts. You can manage who has access from the **Account Shares** page.

#### Viewing Shared Accounts

Accounts that other people have shared with you will appear on the **Shared Accounts** page (`/shared-accounts`) in the sidebar.

### 6. üéØ Financial Planning

5.  Enter the **Amount** you want to limit your spending to.
6.  Track your progress on the Dashboard!

#### Setting Savings Goals

1.  Go to the **Goals** page (`/goal`).
2.  Click **"Add Goal"**.
3.  Give your goal a **Name** (e.g., "Vacation to Italy").
4.  Enter the **Target Amount** you need to save.
5.  Set an optional **Target Date**.
6.  As you save money, click the **Add/Withdraw** buttons in the actions column to update your progress.

#### Tracking Investments

1.  Go to the **Investments** page (`/investment`).
2.  Create an **Investment Account** (e.g., "My Stock Portfolio").
3.  Inside that account, add your individual **Holdings** (e.g., shares of a specific stock), including the number of shares, purchase price, and date.
4.  The app will track your portfolio's performance.

#### Managing Debts

1.  Go to the **Debts** page (`/debts`).
2.  Click **"Add Debt"**.
3.  Log details about loans you've **taken** (money you owe) or **given** (money owed to you).
4.  You can track the principal, interest rate, term, and payment status to stay on top of your liabilities.

### 7. ü§ñ The AI Assistant

The AI Assistant (`/ai-chat`) lets you manage your finances using simple, natural language.

#### How it Works: Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

For maximum privacy, control, and cost-effectiveness, Expense Pro uses a "Bring Your Own Key" model. This means the AI is powered by **your own personal API key** from a provider of your choice (like Google, OpenAI, etc.).

- **Your Privacy:** Your prompts and financial data are sent directly from our server to your chosen AI provider, using your key. We do not process or log your conversations on a central key.
- **Your Control:** You choose the provider and model that best suits your needs and budget.
- **Your Key:** We store your API key securely encrypted in our database and only use it to process your requests on your behalf.

#### Setting Up Your AI Provider

1.  Go to your **Profile** (click your user icon in the bottom-left).
2.  Navigate to the **AI Assistant** tab.
3.  Select an **AI Provider** from the dropdown menu (e.g., Google, OpenAI).
4.  Select a **Model** from the list of available models for that provider.
5.  Paste your personal **API key** from your provider's website into the input field.
6.  Optionally, adjust advanced settings like **Temperature** or provider-specific options like Google's **Safety Settings**.
7.  Click **Save Settings**. The AI Assistant will now be enabled throughout the app.

#### Example Commands

- "Add a 500 INR expense for groceries at Reliance Fresh."
- "How much did I spend on dining out last month?"
- "Show me my top 5 expenses in June."
- You can also upload a receipt image or a PDF bank statement for automatic processing.

### 8. üíæ Data Import & Export

#### Importing from Excel or PDF

1.  Go to the **Import** page (`/transactions/import`).
2.  Select the **Destination Account**.
3.  You can download our **Excel Template** to format your data correctly.
4.  Drag and drop your XLSX or PDF file into the dropzone. For PDFs, the AI will automatically extract transactions.
5.  Review the extracted transactions, make any necessary edits, and confirm the import.

#### Generating Statements

1.  Go to the **Statement** page (`/accounts/statement`).
2.  Select an account and a date range or the number of latest transactions.
3.  Choose either PDF or XLSX format and generate the statement.

#### Exporting Your Data

From the main **Transactions** page, you can use the filters to narrow down your data and then use the **Export** button to download the filtered view as an XLSX or CSV file.

### 9. ‚öôÔ∏è Profile & Settings

Click on your user icon in the bottom-left of the sidebar to access your profile. Here you can:

- **Profile:** Update your name and profile picture. Change your preferred currency.
- **Security:** Manage your password and delete your account.
- **Notifications:** Control your email notification preferences.
- **AI Assistant:** Configure your AI provider, model, and API key.

### 10. ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Why doesn't Expense Pro automatically sync with my bank?**
  For privacy and security, we do not use services like Plaid to connect directly to your bank. We believe you should have full control over when and how your data is shared. Instead, we offer secure, user-initiated import methods like PDF and XLSX uploads.

- **Is my data secure?**
  Yes. We use industry-standard security practices, including password hashing and encryption for sensitive data like your AI API key. Your financial data is yours alone.

- **What is the difference between the Free and Pro plans?**
  All essential features like unlimited accounts, transactions, budgeting, and goals are free forever. The **Pro Plan** is a one-time purchase that unlocks lifetime access to advanced features, primarily the AI Financial Assistant and AI-powered data imports.
