- **Interactive Charts:** Visualize where your money is going with beautiful, easy-to-understand charts for spending breakdowns by category (pie, donut, column) and financial trends over time (line, bar, area).
- **Customizable Widgets:** The dashboard is a modular Bento Grid showing:
  - **Financial Snapshot:** Key metrics overview.
  - **Quick Stats:** Highest/lowest income/expense, transaction counts.
  - **Financial Health Score:** An AI-powered assessment of financial wellness with actionable feedback.
  - **Budget Progress:** Real-time tracking of spending against set budgets.
  - **Goal Highlights:** Visual progress towards your top saving goals.
  - **Investment & Debt Summaries:** High-level overview of your portfolio and liabilities.

- **Account-Specific Analytics:** Drill down into any account to see a dedicated dashboard with analytics just for that account.

### 2.2. Effortless Transaction Management
- **Full CRUD Operations:** Easily add, view, edit, and delete income or expense transactions.
- **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:** Instantly find any transaction by searching for text, or by filtering by date range, category, account, transaction type (income/expense), or amount range.
- **Recurring Transactions:** Set up recurring transactions (like rent or subscriptions) once. The app will handle creating future entries for you, specifying frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) and an optional end date.
- **Category Management:** Assign transactions to categories. Users can create, edit, and delete custom categories. New categories can be created "on-the-fly" directly from the transaction form.

### 2.3. The AI Financial Assistant (A Pro Feature)
- **Conversational Finance:** Use simple, natural language to manage your money. The AI understands commands like:
  - "Add a 500 INR expense for groceries at Reliance Fresh."
  - "How much did I spend on dining out last month?"
  - "Show me a pie chart of my spending this year."
- **AI-Powered Data Import:** This is a major time-saver. Users can upload files, and the AI will process them:
  - **PDF Bank Statements:** The AI reads the document, extracts all transactions, intelligently suggests categories, and presents them for review before a one-click import.
  - **Receipt Images (JPEG, PNG):** Upload a photo of a receipt, and the AI will extract the key details (merchant, amount, date) into a new transaction draft.
  - **Excel (XLSX) files:** The AI can also process structured data from spreadsheets.
- **Privacy-Focused:** The AI assistant is powered by the user's **own personal Google AI API key**, which they provide in their profile settings. The key is stored securely with AES-GCM encryption. All conversations and data are processed through the user's key, ensuring maximum privacy.

### 2.4. Smart Financial Planning Suite
- **Budgeting:** Create monthly or yearly budgets for specific spending categories (e.g., "Food," "Shopping"). Visually track your spending against your budget in real-time.
- **Savings Goals:** Set up savings goals for things like a vacation, a new car, or an emergency fund. Define a target amount and date, contribute to your goal, and watch your progress with visual trackers.
- **Debt Management:** Log and track any loans, whether it's money you've **borrowed (taken)** or money you've **lent (given)**. Track the principal, interest rate (simple or compound), term, and payment status. Includes a built-in interest calculator to model loan scenarios.
- **Investment Tracking:** Consolidate your investment portfolio. Create accounts for different brokerages (e.g., "Zerodha"), add your individual stock or mutual fund holdings (symbol, shares, purchase price), and monitor your total invested amount, current market value, and overall performance.

### 2.5. Data Portability & Collaboration
- **Import & Export with Ease:**
  - **Import:** Start quickly by importing your existing transaction history from a pre-formatted Excel (XLSX) file or by using the AI PDF/Image import.
  - **Export:** Download your transaction data at any time. You can export your entire history or a filtered view into either an **Excel (XLSX)** or **CSV** file.
  - **Statements:** Generate professionally formatted PDF or XLSX statements for any account and any date range.
- **Secure Account Sharing:** Share a specific account (e.g., a "Household" account) with a partner or family member via an email invitation. They can view and contribute to that account without ever seeing your personal accounts. The owner can revoke access at any time.

## 3. Core Product Principles
---

- **User-Centric Design:** The application is designed to be beautiful, fast, and easy to use. Financial management should be clear and accessible, not intimidating. Built with a modern tech stack (Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4).
- **Intelligence, Simplified:** We leverage AI not as a gimmick, but as a powerful tool to automate tedious tasks (like data entry from PDFs) and make complex analysis as simple as asking a question.
- **Open and Transparent:** Expense Pro is open-source under the **MIT License**. The community can inspect the code, contribute, and trust that there are no hidden functionalities.
- **You Own Your Data:** We believe your financial data is yours alone. We provide powerful export tools, ensuring you are always in complete control of your information.

---
## 4. Monetization & Availability
---

- **Core Functionality is Free:** All essential features, including unlimited accounts, transactions, budgeting, and goals, are available for free.
- **Pro Plan:** A **one-time purchase** unlocks lifetime access to advanced features, primarily centered around the **AI Financial Assistant**, **AI-powered data imports**, and advanced analytics like the **Financial Health Score**.

---
## 5. Boundaries & What We Are NOT
---

- **We are NOT a bank.** We do not hold or move real money. We are a tool for tracking and managing data from your existing financial accounts.
- **We do NOT provide direct financial advice.** The AI assistant and analytics provide data-driven insights based on the data you provide. They are not a substitute for professional financial, investment, or tax advice.
- **We do NOT automatically sync with bank accounts.** For privacy and security, we do not use services like Plaid to connect directly to your bank. Instead, we offer secure, user-initiated import methods like PDF and XLSX uploads.
- **The AI Assistant's capabilities are limited to the app's functions.** It can add transactions, retrieve data, and provide summaries based on your records within Expense Pro. It cannot perform actions outside the app, like paying bills or making trades.

---
## 6. User Journeys (How it Works)
---

- **Getting Started:** A new user signs up, verifies their email, creates their first financial account (e.g., "Main Bank Account") with a starting balance, and can then immediately begin adding transactions or importing their history via PDF/XLSX.
- **Tracking Daily Spending:** As the user spends money, they can quickly add an "expense" transaction, giving it a description, amount, and category. If they receive money, they add an "income" transaction.
- **Reviewing Finances Weekly:** The user logs in and checks their dashboard to see a summary of their weekly spending. They might look at the "Spending Breakdown" pie chart to see which category consumed the most money.
- **Planning for the Month:** At the start of a month, a user goes to the "Budgets" section and sets a spending limit for "Dining Out." Throughout the month, they can check their dashboard to see how much of that budget they have left.
- **Preparing for Taxes:** A user can go to the "Transactions" page, filter the date range to the last financial year, filter for a specific category like "Business Expenses," and then export the results to an Excel file for their accountant.

## 8. LLM Interaction Guidelines: Accessing External Knowledge & Tool Use
---

This section outlines how an AI model (like ChatGPT, Claude, or similar) can effectively interact with and gain context about the Expense Pro application, leveraging capabilities beyond its initial training data.

### 8.1. Accessing External Information
AI models can enhance their understanding and provide more accurate assistance by accessing up-to-date or specialized information. This typically involves:
- **Web Search:** For general knowledge, current events, or broad concepts related to personal finance, budgeting, or software development. This allows the AI to retrieve information not present in its training data.
- **Specific APIs/Databases:** For real-time data (e.g., current stock prices, currency exchange rates, financial news) or detailed documentation (e.g., library documentation, API specifications).

### 8.2. Tool Use & System Interaction
AI models can interact with the Expense Pro application's environment and its underlying systems by utilizing provided tools. This enables the AI to:
- **Perform File Operations:** Read, write, or modify files within the project directory (e.g., reading code, updating configuration files, writing documentation).
- **Execute Shell Commands:** Run commands in the operating system's shell (e.g., installing dependencies, running tests, building the application, interacting with version control systems like Git).
- **Interact with Application APIs:** Directly call functions or endpoints exposed by the Expense Pro application's backend (e.g., adding a transaction, fetching account details, managing users). This allows the AI to perform actions within the application's logic.
- **Utilize Specialized Tools:** Access custom tools designed for specific tasks, such as fetching content from URLs (web_fetch), performing structured searches (search_file_content, glob), or interacting with external services (google_web_search, create_or_update_file on GitHub).

By understanding and utilizing these capabilities, an AI model can act as a more effective and autonomous agent in assisting users with the Expense Pro application, from debugging and feature development to providing comprehensive support.
