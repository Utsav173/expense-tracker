### <Icon name='edit' /> Managing Your Transactions

This page is your detailed, searchable log of every financial activity. Keeping it up-to-date is the key to unlocking the full power of Expense Pro's analysis features. It shows a comprehensive table of all your transactions from all accounts by default.

<Step number={1} title='Add a Transaction'>

Click the **"Add Transaction"** button. A modal will appear where you can choose **Expense** or **Income**, then fill in the details:

- **Description:** What the transaction was for (e.g., "Groceries at SuperMart").
- **Amount:** The monetary value.
- **Account:** Which of your accounts was used.
- **Category:** Assign a category for spending analysis (e.g., "Food").
- **Date:** The date the transaction occurred.

</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Edit or Delete'>
  In the transaction list, use the actions menu (...) on the right of each row. From there you can
  choose to **Edit** any detail in a modal or **Delete** the transaction permanently.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Search and Filter'>

Use the powerful controls at the top of the list to find exactly what you need:

- **Search Bar:** Instantly find transactions by text in their description.
- **Filters Button <Icon name='filter' className='inline h-4 w-4' />:** Open a dialog to filter by Account, Category, Type (Income/Expense), Date Range, and Amount Range. Active filters are shown as badges above the table.
- **Export Button <Icon name='download' className='inline h-4 w-4' />:** Export the currently filtered data to an Excel (.xlsx) or CSV file.

</Step>

<Alert variant='success' title='Combine Filters for Powerful Insights'>
  Want to see how much you spent on "Groceries" from your "Main Checking" account last month?
  Combining filters makes this possible in seconds. The exported file will respect your active
  filters.
