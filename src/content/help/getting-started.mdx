### Creating Your First Financial Account

An "Account" in Expense Pro is a digital mirror of a real-world place where you manage money (like a bank account or credit card). To track anything, you first need at least one account.

  You'll land here after your first login, but you can always return to manage all your accounts.
</FeatureLink>

<Step number={1} title="Open the Account Form">
  Click the **"Create Account"** button to open the new account form.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Define Your Account">
  - **Account Name:** Give it a clear, recognizable name, like "HDFC Savings Account" or "Amex Credit Card".
  - **Starting Balance:** This is a crucial step. Enter the **current, actual balance** of that account as of today.
  - **Currency:** Select the correct currency for this account.
</Step>

### Understanding the Layout

The app is designed for simplicity and power.

<Step number={1} title="The Sidebar">
  Your primary navigation hub on the left. It's organized into logical groups: **Analytics**, **Management**, and **Planning**. You can collapse it to an icon-only view to maximize your workspace.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="The Main Content Area">
  This is your workspace on the right. It displays the page you've selected from the sidebar, such as your Dashboard or Transactions list.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Keyboard Shortcuts">
  We love efficiency! Press <Keybind>Ctrl</Keybind> + <Keybind>B</Keybind> (or <Keybind>⌘</Keybind> + <Keybind>B</Keybind> on Mac) to quickly show or hide the sidebar at any time.
</Step>
