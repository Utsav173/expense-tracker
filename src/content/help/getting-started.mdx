  Creating Your First Financial Account
</span>

An "Account" in Expense Pro is a digital mirror of a real-world place where you manage money (like a bank account or credit card). To track anything, you first need at least one account. After your first login, you will be directed to the Accounts page to create one.

<Step number={1} title='Open the Account Form'>
  Click the **"Add Account"** button to open the new account form.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Define Your Account'>

- **Account Name:** Give it a clear, recognizable name, like "HDFC Savings Account" or "Amex Credit Card".
- **Starting Balance:** This is a crucial step. Enter the **current, actual balance** of that account as of today.
- **Currency:** Select the correct currency for this account from the dropdown.

</Step>

<Alert variant='tip' title='Be Thorough for Accuracy!'>
  For the most accurate financial picture, create an account in Expense Pro for every real-world
  account you use to spend or receive money—including bank accounts, credit cards, digital wallets,
  and even physical cash.
