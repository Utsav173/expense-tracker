### Creating Your First Financial Account
An "Account" in Expense Pro is a digital mirror of a real-world place where you manage money. To track anything, you first need at least one account.

1.  **Go to the Accounts Page:** You'll land here after your first login.
2.  **Click "Create Account":** This opens the new account form.
3.  **Account Name:** Give it a clear, recognizable name, like "HDFC Savings Account" or "Amex Credit Card".
4.  **Starting Balance:** This is a crucial step. Enter the **current, actual balance** of that account as of today.
5.  **Currency:** Select the correct currency for this account.

### Understanding the Layout
The app is designed for simplicity and power.
*   **Sidebar (Left):** Your primary navigation hub. It's organized into logical groups. You can collapse it to an icon-only view to maximize your workspace.
*   **Main Content Area (Right):** This is your workspace. It displays the page you've selected from the sidebar.
*   **Keyboard Shortcut:** Press <Keybind>Ctrl</Keybind> + <Keybind>B</Keybind> (or <Keybind>⌘</Keybind> + <Keybind>B</Keybind> on Mac) to toggle the sidebar at any time.
