Transactions are the heartbeat of your financial tracking. Every coffee you buy, every paycheck you receive, and every bill you pay is a transaction.

This is the heart of Expense Pro. The Transactions page gives you granular control over every financial record.

### Adding a Transaction

Click the **"Add Transaction"** button. You can manually enter details or use the AI Assistant to "Add a coffee for $5".

### Editing & Deleting

Click on any transaction row to open its details. From here, you can update the amount, category, or date, or delete it entirely if it was a mistake.

### Filtering & Searching

The powerful filter bar allows you to slice and dice your data:

- **Search:** Find transactions by description (e.g., "Uber", "Netflix").
- **Date Range:** View spending for a specific week, month, or year.
- **Type:** See only Income, Expenses, or Transfers.
- **Category:** Drill down into specific spending habits.
- **Account:** Focus on a single bank account or credit card.
