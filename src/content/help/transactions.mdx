The Transactions page is the heart of your financial record-keeping. Think of it as your personal, supercharged bank ledger. It's a detailed, searchable log of every financial activity you've recorded across all your accounts.

### Adding an Expense or Income

This is the most common action you'll perform. We've made it fast and intuitive.

<Step number={1} title="Open the Transaction Form">
  Click the **"Add Transaction"** button, usually found at the top of the page. This will open a form ready for your input.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Choose the Type">
  At the top of the form, select **Expense** (money out) or **Income** (money in). The form's accent color will change to red for expenses and green for income, giving you a clear visual cue.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Fill in the Details">
  - **Description:** Be specific! "Coffee with Sarah at Blue Tokai" is far more useful than just "Coffee." This will make searching for it later a breeze.
  - **Amount:** The exact monetary value.
  - **Account:** Select which of your financial accounts this transaction affects.
  - **Category:** Assign a spending category. This is crucial for accurate reports.
  - **Date and Time:** Defaults to the current moment, but you can click to back-date transactions if you're catching up on your bookkeeping.
</Step>

<Alert variant="tip" title="Create Categories On-the-Fly">
  If the perfect category doesn't exist, don't break your flow! Just start typing a new name (e.g., "Home Office Supplies") in the category field and select the **"Create..."** option that appears. It's the fastest way to build a category system that perfectly fits your life.
</Alert>

<Step number={4} title="Consider Optional Details (for Power Users)">
  - **Recurring Transaction:** Is this a regular payment like a Netflix subscription, rent, or salary? Check this box. You can then set the **Frequency** (e.g., monthly) and an optional **End Date**. The app will automatically generate these transactions for you in the future, saving you manual entry time.
  - **Transfer Details:** Add extra context here. For an expense, you could put "Paid via GPay." For an income, you could put "From John Doe."
</Step>

### Editing and Deleting

Your records are not set in stone. In the transaction list, find the transaction you want to change and use the actions column:
- **To Edit:** Click the **pencil icon** (<Icon name="pencil" className="inline h-4 w-4" />). A modal will appear allowing you to modify any detail.
- **To Delete:** Click the **trash can icon** (<Icon name="trash2" className="inline h-4 w-4" />). A confirmation will appear. This action is permanent.

### Searching and Filtering

This is how you turn your data into answers. The controls are at the top of the transaction list.

- **Global Search:** Use the main search bar to instantly find transactions by their description or transfer details.
- **Advanced Filters:** Click the **"Filters"** button to open a dialog where you can combine multiple criteria:
  - Account
  - Category
  - Type (Income or Expense)
  - Date Range
  - Amount Range (Min/Max)
