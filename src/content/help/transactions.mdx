## <Icon name="transaction" /> Transactions Page

The Transactions page is the heart of your financial record-keeping. Think of it as your personal, supercharged bank ledger. It's a detailed, searchable log of every financial activity you've recorded across all your accounts. Keeping this up-to-date is the key to unlocking the full power of Expense Pro.

### Adding an Expense or Income
This is the most common action you'll perform. We've made it fast and intuitive.

1.  Click the **"Add Transaction"** button.
2.  **Choose Type:** At the top of the form, select **Expense** (money out) or **Income** (money in). The form's accent color will change to red for expenses and green for income.
3.  **Description:** Be specific! "Coffee with Sarah at Blue Tokai" is far more useful than just "Coffee." This will make searching for it later a breeze.
4.  **Amount:** The exact monetary value.
5.  **Account:** Select which of your financial accounts this transaction affects.
6.  **Category:** Assign a spending category. This is crucial for accurate reports.

If the perfect category doesn't exist, don't break your flow! Just start typing a new name (e.g., "Home Office Supplies") in the category field and select the **"Create..."** option that appears. It's the fastest way to build a category system that perfectly fits your life.

7.  **Date and Time:** Defaults to the current moment, but you can click to back-date transactions if you're catching up on your bookkeeping.
8.  **Optional Details:**
    *   **Recurring Transaction:** Is this a regular payment like a Netflix subscription, rent, or salary? Check this box. You can then set the **Frequency** (e.g., monthly) and an optional **End Date**. The app will automatically generate these transactions for you in the future, saving you manual entry time.
    *   **Transfer Details:** Add extra context here. For an expense, you could put "Paid via GPay." For an income, you could put "From John Doe."
