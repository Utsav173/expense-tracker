### <Icon name='list' /> The Main Accounts List

This is your central hub for viewing all your financial accounts at a glance. Each account is displayed on a card showing its current **Balance**, and a summary of its recent activity, giving you a quick check on its health.

The page includes a search bar to quickly find accounts by name and pagination if you have a large number of accounts.

<Step number={1} title='Create a New Account'>

Click the **"Add Account"** button. You'll need to provide a name (e.g., "ICICI Savings"), its
current starting balance, and the currency. You can also set an account as the "default" account,
which may be pre-selected in other parts of the application.

</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Add a Quick Transaction'>

The **"Add Transaction"** button at the top of the page lets you quickly record an income or
expense without needing to navigate to the full transactions page first.

</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Perform Actions on an Account'>

Hover over any account card to reveal quick action buttons:

- **Edit <Icon name='edit' className='inline h-4 w-4' />:** Opens a modal to update the account's name.
- **Delete <Icon name='trash' className='inline h-4 w-4' />:** Opens a confirmation dialog to delete the account.

</Step>

<Alert variant='destructive' title='Warning: Deleting an Account is Permanent'>

Deleting an account will also permanently erase **all of its associated transactions, budget
links, and goal contributions**. This action cannot be undone. Please be absolutely certain before
you confirm.
