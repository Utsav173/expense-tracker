### <Icon name='keyRound' /> Setting Up Your AI Provider for Privacy

For maximum user privacy and control, the AI Assistant is powered by **your own personal API key** from a provider of your choice. This "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model means your financial data is sent from our secure server directly to the AI provider you trust, using your key. We never see or log your raw API key.

<Step number={1} title='Navigate to AI Settings'>
  Go to your **Profile** by clicking your user icon in the bottom-left of the sidebar. From there,
  select the **AI Assistant** tab to begin the setup.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Choose Your Provider and Model'>

- **Select an AI Provider:** Use the dropdown to choose your preferred service (e.g., Google, OpenAI, Anthropic).
- **Select a Model:** Based on your provider, a list of available models will appear. Choose the one you'd like to use.

</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Enter Your API Key'>
  Each provider has a section on their website for generating API keys. Click the link on the
  settings page to go directly to your chosen provider's key management page, create a key, and
  paste it into the "API Key" input field.
</Step>

<Step number={4} title='Configure Options (Optional) & Save'>
  You can fine-tune the AI's behavior by adjusting the **Temperature** or provider-specific settings
  like **Google Safety Settings**. Once you're done, click **Save Settings**. The AI Assistant will
  be enabled immediately across the app.
</Step>

<Alert>
  Your API key is stored securely in our database using strong AES-GCM encryption. It is only ever
  decrypted on the server when needed to process your AI requests on your behalf.
