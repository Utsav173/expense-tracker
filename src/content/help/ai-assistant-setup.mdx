### <Icon name='keyRound' /> Setting Up Your API Key for Privacy

For maximum user privacy, the AI Assistant is powered by **your own personal Google AI API key**. This means your financial data is never sent to a shared, third-party AI model. It's your data, processed with your key.

  First, you'll need a free API key from Google AI Studio.
