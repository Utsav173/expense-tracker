### <Icon name='fileDown' /> Exporting Your Data

It's your data. Export it anytime for offline analysis, accounting, or personal records.

<Step number={1} title='Navigate to the Transactions Page'>
  The export functionality lives on the main **Transactions** page, as it allows you to first filter
  the exact data you need.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Filter Your Data (Optional but Recommended)'>
  Use the powerful filtering options at the top of the page to narrow down the data. You can filter
  by date range, account, category, and more. This ensures your exported file contains only the
  relevant information. For example, you could filter for all "Business" expenses from the last
  financial year.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Click Export and Choose a Format'>

Once your filters are applied, click the **"Export"** button. You will be given a choice of two formats:

- **Excel (.xlsx):** Best for use in spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets.
- **CSV (.csv):** A universal plain-text format compatible with nearly any data tool.
