### <Icon name="coins" /> Debts

Get a clear, centralized view of all your liabilities, whether you've borrowed money or lent it to someone else. This page helps you manage personal loans, credit card debt, and money you've lent to others.

<Step number={1} title="Filter and Search Your Debts">
  At the top of the page, you can filter the list to show all debts, only money you have **Given**, or only money you have **Taken**. You can also use the search bar to find a specific debt by its description or the counterparty involved.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Add a Debt">
  Click **"Add Debt"** and specify whether you have **Taken** (borrowed) or **Given** (lent) the money. Record the principal amount, interest rate, term, and the other party involved. This creates a new entry in the table.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Manage Individual Debts">
  The main table lists all your debts with their key details. Use the action menu (...) on the right of each debt to:
  - **Edit:** Modify the details of the debt.
  - **Delete:** Permanently remove the debt record.
  - **Add Repayment:** Log a payment made or received against the debt, which will update its outstanding balance.
</Step>

<Alert variant="tip" title="Use the Interest Calculator">
  Not sure about the terms of a potential loan? Before creating a debt record, click the **"Calculator"** button. This opens a modal where you can model different scenarios (amount, interest rate, term) and see the total interest you would pay. You can then use these calculated values to pre-fill the "Add Debt" form.
