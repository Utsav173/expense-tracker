### <span><Icon name='uploadCloud' /> Importing Data</span>

This is the fastest way to get your historical data into the app. The import wizard is a step-by-step process to upload a file and bulk-add your transaction history from a bank or another software.

<Step number={1} title='Step 1: Upload'>

- **Select Account:** First, choose the destination account for the imported transactions from the
  dropdown menu.
- **Provide File:** Drag and drop your file onto the upload area, or click to
  browse. The system can process Excel files and, with AI, can often read PDF bank statements.

<Alert variant='tip' title='Which format should I use?'>
  
- **Excel (XLSX):** For the most reliable results, **download the Excel template** from the import
  page. This ensures all your data columns are mapped correctly. - **PDF:** If you have a standard
  bank statement, the AI can often read it automatically. If the PDF is password-protected, you will
  be prompted to enter the password. This is a massive time-saver!

After processing, a preview dialog will appear showing all the transactions extracted from your file.

- **Select:** Use the checkboxes to select only the transactions you wish to import. By default, all are selected. Uncheck any duplicates or unwanted entries.
- **Confirm:** Click **"Confirm and Stage"** to move to the final step.

</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Step 3: Final Confirmation'>
  A final confirmation dialog will appear summarizing the number of transactions you are about to
  import. Click **"Import Transactions"** to permanently add them to your selected account. You will
