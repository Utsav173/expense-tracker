<Alert variant="tip" title="Which format should I use?">
  - **Excel (XLSX):** For the most reliable results, **download our Excel template** from the import page. This ensures all your data is mapped correctly.
  - **PDF:** If you have a standard bank statement, our AI can often read it automatically. This can be a huge time-saver!
