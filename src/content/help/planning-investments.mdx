#### <Icon name='briefcase' /> Investment Accounts Page

<Step number={1} title='Create an Investment Account'>
  Click the **"Add New Account"** button. You'll need to provide a **Name**, the **Platform/Broker**
  (e.g., Fidelity, Vanguard), and the **Currency**.

<Step number={2} title='View Account Summaries'>
  Each investment account is shown on a card with key metrics: **Total Invested**, **Current
  Value**, and **Overall Profit/Loss**. This gives you a high-level snapshot of each portfolio's
  health. Click on a card to drill down into its details.
