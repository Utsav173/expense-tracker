### <Icon name='fileText' /> Generating Statements

Need a professional-looking statement for your records or to share? You can generate one for any account from the dedicated Statement page.

This page allows you to create and download a PDF or Excel statement for a specific account based on a date range or the number of recent transactions.

<Step number={1} title='Select an Account'>
  Use the dropdown menu to choose the account for which you want to generate a statement. The date
  picker will automatically adjust to the range of available transaction dates for that account.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Define the Scope">

You have two ways to define what the statement includes:

- **By Date Range:** Use the date picker to select a specific start and end date.
- **By Latest Transactions:** Enter a number (e.g., 100) to get a statement of the most recent transactions.

You can also use the quick-select presets for common periods like "This Month," "Last Month," "This Year," or "Last Year."

</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Choose the Format'>
  Select either **PDF** for a professionally formatted, printable document or **XLSX** for a raw
  data file compatible with spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets.
</Step>

<Step number={4} title='Generate'>
  Click the **"Generate Statement"** button. Your file will be generated and downloaded
  automatically.
</Step>

<Alert variant='success' title='Professional PDFs'>
  The PDF statements are cleanly formatted with your account details and a clear transaction
  history, suitable for official use such as for accounting or loan applications.
