### Importing Your Transactions

This is the fastest way to get your historical data into the app. Our import wizard guides you through the process.

<FeatureLink href="/transactions/import" title="Go to the Import Wizard" icon="uploadCloud">
  Start here to upload files and bulk-add your transaction history from a previous bank or software.
</FeatureLink>

<Step number={1} title="Upload Your File">
  First, select the account you want to import transactions into. Then, provide your file. We recommend using our template for the best results, but we can also process standard PDF bank statements using AI.
</Step>

<Alert variant="tip" title="Which format should I use?">
  - **Excel (XLSX):** For the most reliable results, **download our sample template** from the import page. This ensures all your data is mapped correctly.
  - **PDF:** If you have a standard bank statement, our AI can often read it automatically. This can be a huge time-saver!

<Step number={2} title="Review and Confirm">

</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Complete the Import">
  Once you're happy with the selection, click the "Confirm Import" button. The transactions will be permanently added to your account.
