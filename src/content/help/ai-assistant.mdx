### Setting Up Your API Key for Privacy

For maximum user privacy, the AI Assistant is powered by **your own personal Google AI API key**. This means your financial data is never sent to a shared, third-party AI model. It's your data, processed with your key.

<Step number={1} title="Get Your Google AI Key">
  First, you'll need a free API key from Google AI Studio.
  <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary font-medium underline underline-offset-4">Click here to visit the Google AI Studio</a>, sign in with your Google account, and create a new API key.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Save Your Key in Expense Pro">
  Navigate to your profile, find the AI Assistant tab, paste your copied key into the field, and click **Save**.

</Step>

<Alert>
  Your API key is stored securely with strong encryption and is only ever used by you to process your requests.

### How to Use the AI Assistant

Open the AI Assistant from the sidebar or by clicking the floating chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of most pages.

<Step number={1} title="Ask Questions in Plain English">
  You can ask complex questions about your finances. For example:
  - "What was my total spending last month?"
  - "How much did I spend on groceries in June?"
  - "Show me my highest expense this year."
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Add Transactions with Your Voice (or Keyboard)">
  Simply type what you did, and the AI will understand. For example:
  - "Add an expense of 75 for a coffee at CCD"
  - "I received my 5000 salary today"
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Request Data Visualizations">
  The AI can generate charts on the fly to help you understand your data. Try asking:
  - "Show a pie chart of my spending this month."
  - "Give me a bar chart of my income vs expenses for the last 6 months."
</Step>

<Alert variant="success" title="Power Feature: File Uploads">
  Drag and drop a file or click the paperclip icon (<Icon name="paperclip" className="inline h-4 w-4" />) to have the AI analyze it.
  - **Receipts (Images):** Upload a photo of a receipt, and the AI will extract the details and queue it up as a transaction.
  - **Bank Statements (PDF/XLSX):** Upload a statement. The AI will analyze it, extract all transactions, and present them for you to review and import in a single click. This is a massive time-saver!
