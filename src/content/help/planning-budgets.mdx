### <Icon name='budget' /> Budgets

Budgets are your primary tool for controlling spending and ensuring your money goes where you want it to. You can create monthly or yearly budgets for any spending category.

On this page, you can see a table of all your created budgets, search them by name, and see their details at a glance.

<Step number={1} title='Create a Budget'>

Click the **"Add Budget"** button. In the modal, you will need to specify:

- **Category:** The spending category this budget applies to (e.g., "Dining Out").
- **Amount:** The maximum amount you want to spend in this category.
- **Month and Year:** The period this budget is for.

</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Track Your Progress'>
  The app automatically tracks your spending in that category against the budget you set. In the
  budget list, you can see the budgeted amount, the actual amount spent, and the remaining balance.
  The main Dashboard also features a "Budget Progress" widget for a quick visual summary of how
  you're doing.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Manage Budgets'>
  Use the action menu on the right of each budget in the table to **Edit** its amount or **Delete**
  it.
</Step>
