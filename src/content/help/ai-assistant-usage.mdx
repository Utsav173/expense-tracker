### <Icon name='bot' /> How to Use the AI Assistant

Once your key is set up, you can open the AI Assistant from the main sidebar or by clicking the floating chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of most pages. If you don't have a key, the AI Chat page will guide you to your profile to add one.

<Step number={1} title='Ask Questions in Plain English'>
  You can ask complex questions about your finances, and the AI will query your data to find the answer. For example:
  - "What was my total spending last month?"
  - "How much did I spend on groceries in June?"
  - "Show me my highest expense this year."
</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Add Transactions with Natural Language'>
  Simply type what you did, and the AI will understand and pre-fill the transaction form for you. For example:
  - "Add an expense of 75 for a coffee at CCD"
  - "I received my 5000 salary today"
</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Request Data Visualizations'>
  The AI can generate charts on the fly to help you understand your data. Try asking:
  - "Show a pie chart of my spending this month."
  - "Give me a bar chart of my income vs expenses for the last 6 months."
  The AI will render the chart directly in the chat window.

<Alert variant='success' title='Power Feature: File Uploads for Analysis'>
  Drag and drop a file or click the paperclip icon <Icon name='paperclip' className='inline h-4 w-4' /> to have the AI analyze it.
  - **Receipts (Images):** Upload a photo of a receipt, and the AI will extract the details and queue it up as a transaction.
  - **Bank Statements (PDF/XLSX):** Upload a statement. The AI will analyze it, extract all transactions, and present them for you to review and import in a single click. This is a massive time-saver!
