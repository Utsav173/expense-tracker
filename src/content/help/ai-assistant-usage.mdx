### <Icon name='bot' /> How to Use the AI Assistant

Once your key is set up, you can open the AI Assistant from the sidebar or by clicking the floating chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of most pages.

<Step number={1} title='Ask Questions in Plain English'>
  You can ask complex questions about your finances. For example: - "What was my total spending last
  month?" - "How much did I spend on groceries in June?" - "Show me my highest expense this year."
</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Add Transactions with Your Voice (or Keyboard)'>
  Simply type what you did, and the AI will understand. For example: - "Add an expense of 75 for a
  coffee at CCD" - "I received my 5000 salary today"
</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Request Data Visualizations'>
  The AI can generate charts on the fly to help you understand your data. Try asking: - "Show a pie
  chart of my spending this month." - "Give me a bar chart of my income vs expenses for the last 6
  months."
</Step>
