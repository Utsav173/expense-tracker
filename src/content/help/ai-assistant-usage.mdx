### <span><Icon name='bot' /> How to Use the AI Assistant</span>

Once your key is set up, you can open the AI Assistant from the main sidebar or by clicking the floating chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of most pages. If you don't have a key, the AI Chat page will guide you to your profile to add one.

<Step number={1} title='Ask Questions in Plain English'>

You can ask complex questions about your finances, and the AI will query your data to find the answer. For example:

- "What was my total spending last month?"
- "How much did I spend on groceries in June?"
- "Show me my highest expense this year."

</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Add Transactions with Natural Language'>

Simply type what you did, and the AI will understand and pre-fill the transaction form for you. For example:

- "Add an expense of 75 for a coffee at CCD"
- "I received my 5000 salary today"

</Step>

<Step number={3} title='Request Data Visualizations'>

The AI can generate charts on the fly to help you understand your data. Try asking:

- "Show a pie chart of my spending this month."
- "Give me a bar chart of my income vs expenses for the last 6 months."

The AI will render the chart directly in the chat window.

Drag and drop a file or click the paperclip icon <Icon name='paperclip' className='inline h-4 w-4' /> to have the AI analyze it: - **Receipts
(Images):** Upload a photo of a receipt, and the AI will extract the details and queue it up as a
transaction. - **Bank Statements (PDF/XLSX):** Upload a statement. The AI will analyze it, extract
all transactions, and present them for you to review and import in a single click. This is a massive
time-saver!
