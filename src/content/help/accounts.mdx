### The Account Details Page

Clicking on any account card takes you to its dedicated detail page for an in-depth analysis.

<Step number={1} title="Use the Header Actions">
  At the top of the page, you'll find a set of powerful tools specific to this account:
  - <Icon name="download" className="inline h-4 w-4" /> **Export:** Instantly download a PDF of the current view.
  - <Icon name="fileText" className="inline h-4 w-4" /> **Statement:** Go to the dedicated page to generate a formal PDF or XLSX statement.
  - <Icon name="users" className="inline h-4 w-4" /> **View Shares:** See and manage who you have shared this account with.
  - <Icon name="share2" className="inline h-4 w-4" /> **Share:** Invite another user to view this account's data.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Analyze Focused Analytics">
  All charts, stats, and transaction lists on this page are filtered to show data *only* for the selected account. This is perfect for deep-diving into the performance and history of a single account without the noise of others.

### Account Sharing

Securely share specific accounts with a partner, accountant, or family member without giving them access to your entire profile.

<FeatureLink href="/shared-accounts" title="Manage Your Shared Accounts" icon="users">
  Control who has access to your accounts and view accounts that have been shared with you.
</FeatureLink>

<Step number={1} title="Sharing an Account">
  From the **Account Details** page, click the **Share** icon. You will be prompted to enter the email address of the user you wish to invite. They will receive an email notification.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Managing Access">
  On the **Account Sharing** page, you can see a list of everyone who has access to your accounts. As the owner, you can **Revoke** their access at any time.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Viewing Shared-With-Me Accounts">
  The "Shared With Me" tab on the sharing page lists all accounts other users have shared with you. This keeps them separate from your personal accounts for privacy and clarity.
</Step>
