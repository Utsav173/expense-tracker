Securely share specific accounts with a partner, accountant, or family member without giving them access to your entire profile. This feature is split into two key areas: sharing your accounts and viewing accounts shared with you.

When you are the owner of an account, you have full control over who can see it.

<Step number={1} title='Sharing an Account'>
  From the **Account Details** page, click the **Share Account** <Icon name='share' className='inline h-4 w-4' /> icon. You will be prompted to enter the email address of the user you wish to invite. They will receive an email notification to accept the invitation.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title='Managing Access'>
  Navigate to the **Account Shares** page by clicking the **View Shares** <Icon name='users' className='inline h-4 w-4' /> button on the Account Details page. Here, you can see a list of everyone who has access, including their name and email. As the owner, you can **Revoke** their access at any time using the dropdown menu on their card.

#### <Icon name="userCog" /> Viewing Accounts Shared With You

This page provides a dedicated space to see all the financial accounts that other Expense Pro users have granted you access to.

<Step number={1} title='Access the Page'>
  Click on **"Shared Accounts"** in the main sidebar under the "Manage" section. This keeps accounts others share with you separate from your personal accounts for privacy and clarity.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title='View and Interact'>
  Each shared account is displayed as a card, showing its name, the owner's name, and the current balance. You can search for specific accounts and click on any card to navigate to its **Account Details** page, where you can view its transactions and analytics in a read-only mode.
