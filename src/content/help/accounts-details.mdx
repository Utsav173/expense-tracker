### <Icon name="search" /> The Account Details Page

Clicking on any account card from the list takes you to its dedicated detail page for an in-depth analysis. All charts, stats, and the transaction list on this page are filtered to show data *only* for the selected account.

<Step number={1} title="Analyze Focused Analytics">
  The **Analytics Cards** and **Financial Trends** chart at the top of the page are specific to this account. This is perfect for deep-diving into the performance and history of a single account without the noise of others. The trends chart shows income, expenses, and balance over time, and you can adjust the duration (e.g., 7 days, 30 days, 1 year).
